                <h2>WHAT IS A REFUGEE?</h2>
                <p>A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war or violence. A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Most likely, they cannot return home or are afraid to do so. War and ethnic, tribal and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their countries.</p>

                    <h2>Why should people care about refugees?</h2>
                    <p>For years,People have been bombarded with news of the horrors of the world and the wrath it brings onto the people   be      extended so far before it starts getting mentally exhausting.
                        So i get people who don't care about these things. It´s easy not to care and attribute it to a cruel world. Better to seek happiness in your own life then worry about others.
                        So why should people care?We definitely should for the sake of the validity of their existence,but why else?
                        well there is the fact like Justin Turner points out that it's good to care about these things as you never know when you or your descendants will be refugees.

                        But i think that the more fundamental reason is that bad things happen when we don´t. What drives a refugee is desperation: And desperation has made and unmade nations.
                        And even if we're in a situation where these people aren't coming to our doorsteps ,it doesen't change the fact that we live in a global society.What affects one affects everyone else in some way.Refugees are victims of instability  and that instability will spread if it isn't treated in some way. As an example, Isis was born of it and Isis thrives on it. It and other entities like it can not be effectively ended without stabilizing the places they control.

                        A large part of stabilization is removing that desperation,To make people believe they can get what they want without compromising their lives or way of life. To do that,we must make sure that these refugees are not simply surviving,But truly live a life they can be happy with.
                        That's why you should care. It's in everyones interests for the refugees to be treated kindly and helped.
